  'Indian Music Therapy Association (Estd. 2018) is the national-level accreditation agency for professionals in Music Therapy — music therapists, music therapy trainers, consultants — and organizations such as coaching centres, elderly homes, government prisons, gyms, hospitals, medical institutions, nursing homes, rehabilitation centres, schools for special children, spas, and similar settings that cater to music therapy in India.',
  'As its sister organization, Nada Centre for Music Therapy (2004–2026) had to be closed recently due to certain operational issues, and the world-pioneering Distance Learning Programme also came to a halt.',
  'To meet the growing demand for this popular programme, Indian Music Therapy Association is pleased to come forward and sponsor the 22nd Batch with effect from 1st July 2026. While Dr. T. V. Sairam, the author of this programme, will continue to serve as the Honorary Programme Director, Dr. C. Lalithambal has also volunteered to be the Honorary Faculty.',
  'IMTA welcomes all those who are ready to face the academic challenges that Music Therapy offers. It may be recalled that in the last two decades, over 1,000 students have successfully completed this programme and have found it relevant and useful.',

  },
}

export const pgDiplomaDisclaimer =
  'Music therapy concepts and practices revolve around emotions, due to which linguistic expression becomes highly limited. Music therapy is celebrated as holistic medicine, rather than a stand-alone intervention. As music therapy is yet to be recognized in India, at present job opportunities for those who have completed the programme are rather limited.'
